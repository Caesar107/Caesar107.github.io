## Hello, I'm Menglin Zou! 👋

I'm a passionate AI researcher currently pursuing my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at The University of Auckland. With a strong foundation in computer science and a focus on cutting-edge AI technologies, I enjoy creating intelligent solutions that bridge theoretical research with practical applications.

## My Journey

My journey in artificial intelligence began during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at Southwest University, where I discovered my passion for machine learning and deep learning. This led me to pursue advanced studies in AI at The University of Auckland, where I'm currently working on research in inverse reinforcement learning and deep neural networks.

### What Drives Me

I'm particularly interested in:

- **Deep Learning**: Developing advanced neural network architectures and optimization techniques
- **Computer Vision**: Creating intelligent systems for facial recognition, emotion detection, and image classification
- **Natural Language Processing**: Building conversational AI and language understanding systems
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Researching stable reward learning and policy optimization methods
- **Research & Innovation**: Contributing to the scientific community through publications and open-source projects

## Current Focus

Currently, I'm diving deep into:

- 🔬 **Research**: Working on PIRO (Toward Stable Reward Learning for Inverse RL) submitted to NeurIPS 2025
- 🧠 **Deep Learning**: Exploring methods to prevent dormant neurons in deep reinforcement learning
- 👁️ **Computer Vision**: Developing advanced facial recognition and emotion detection systems
- 🤖 **AI Applications**: Building emotion-aware chatbot robots and intelligent recommendation systems
- 📚 **Teaching**: Serving as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Mathematics for Computer Science

## Beyond Research

When I'm not working on AI research, you can find me:

- 📊 Analyzing data and building machine learning models for real-world problems
- 💻 Contributing to open-source AI projects and frameworks
- 🎯 Developing practical AI applications that solve everyday challenges
- 🌱 Learning about the latest advances in AI and machine learning
- 🤝 Collaborating with fellow researchers and industry professionals

## Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to discuss new ideas, potential research collaborations, or opportunities in AI and machine learning. Feel free to reach out through any of my social media channels or send me an email!
