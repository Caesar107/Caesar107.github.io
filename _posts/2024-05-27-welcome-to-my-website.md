Hello and welcome to my personal website! ðŸŽ‰

I'm excited to finally launch my digital portfolio and blog. This has been a project I've been wanting to tackle for a while, and I'm thrilled to share it with you.

## Why I Built This Site

As a software engineer and graduate student, I wanted a platform to:

- **Showcase my projects**: Share the technical solutions I've been working on
- **Document my learning journey**: Write about new technologies and insights
- **Connect with the community**: Engage with fellow developers and tech enthusiasts
- **Professional presence**: Have a central hub for my professional information

## Technology Stack

This website is built using:

- **Jekyll**: Static site generator for fast, secure websites
- **Minimal Mistakes**: A flexible and customizable Jekyll theme
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with automatic deployment
- **Markdown**: Simple content creation and management

## What You Can Expect

Moving forward, I plan to write about:

### ðŸ”§ Technical Deep Dives
- Algorithm implementations and optimizations
- Framework comparisons and best practices
- Cloud computing and DevOps experiences
