Hello and welcome to my AI research portfolio! ðŸŽ‰

I'm Menglin Zou, currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at The University of Auckland. I'm excited to finally launch this digital platform to share my research journey, projects, and insights in the fascinating world of AI and machine learning.

## Why I Built This Site

As an AI researcher and graduate student, I wanted a platform to:

- **Showcase my research**: Share my work in inverse reinforcement learning, computer vision, and deep learning
- **Document my AI journey**: Write about cutting-edge technologies and research insights
- **Connect with the AI community**: Engage with fellow researchers, practitioners, and AI enthusiasts
- **Academic presence**: Have a central hub for my research publications and academic achievements

## Technology Stack

This website is built using:

- **Jekyll**: Static site generator for fast, secure websites
- **Minimal Mistakes**: A flexible and customizable Jekyll theme
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with automatic deployment
- **Markdown**: Simple content creation and management

## What You Can Expect

Moving forward, I plan to write about:

### ðŸ”¬ AI Research Deep Dives
- Inverse reinforcement learning methodologies
- Deep learning optimization techniques
- Computer vision and emotion recognition systems
- Natural language processing applications

### ðŸ§  Machine Learning Adventures
- PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations
- Neural network architectures and innovations
- Reinforcement learning algorithms and experiments
- AI model deployment and optimization

### ðŸ’¡ AI Project Showcases
- Detailed breakdowns of my emotion-aware chatbot robot
- Facial recognition and computer vision systems
- Deep reinforcement learning research implementations
- Nutritional recommendation systems using DSSM

### ðŸŽ¯ Research Journey
- Graduate school experiences at The University of Auckland
- Research collaboration and publication process
- Academic conference insights and networking
- Teaching assistant experiences and mentoring

## Current Research & Projects

I'm currently working on several exciting AI research projects:

1. **PIRO Research**: Stable reward learning for inverse RL via monotonic policy divergence reduction (submitted to NeurIPS 2025)
2. **Emotion-Aware Chatbot**: Combining computer vision, emotion AI, and NLP for interactive human-robot communication
3. **Dormant Neurons in Deep RL**: Novel PRNA method for preventing neuron dormancy in deep reinforcement learning
4. **Apple Leaf Disease Classification**: Computer vision system for agricultural disease detection

Stay tuned for detailed posts about each of these research endeavors!
